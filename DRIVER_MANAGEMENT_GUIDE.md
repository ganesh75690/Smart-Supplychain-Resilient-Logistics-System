### **📊 Driver Assignment Logic**

```
Driver Structure:
├── Organization (always assigned)
└── Supplier (optional)
    ├── Supplier A Drivers
    ├── Supplier B Drivers  
    └── Organization Only (no supplier)
```

**Assignment Flow**:
1. **Admin** can assign driver to any supplier or org-only
2. **Supplier** can only manage their assigned drivers
3. **Drivers** belong to organization + optional supplier
